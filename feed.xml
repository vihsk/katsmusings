<p>“Validating is not fixing, correcting, teaching a lesson, or providing advice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>lately i’ve been thinking about why i don’t create more when i’ve been <em>buzzing</em> with ideas. 
the ideas sound like this in my head: 
    - “this <em>weirdly specific</em> thing i use daily kinda sucks, why don’t i fix it? i shan’t complain if i can’t make it better, no?” 
    - “i just made a connection so outlandish i don’t even really think it’s possible” 
    - “this is morbidly funny, what more is there?”</p><p>when the beehive (my many streams of thought) is angered i usually go on to research everything and anything that remotely connects to this thing. it takes up a lot of my day. 
i tend to research everything i am curious about very deeply, but i don’t tend to write about it. </p><p>to the annoyances of my friend (the one i am emotionally handcuffed to at the time), after hours of research, i run my ideas past them. try to mention them casually, as if i’ve just heard about the thing, trying to gauge if its something to be interested in. </p><p>now here’s the kicker: the idea lives or dies here. if my friend, for any reason, does not respond in a way my trauma-damaged brain has deemed as acceptable, the idea and the hours of research are in vain. 
the moment of getting a response gives me an adrenaline rush and a pang of pain at the same time: my emotional state is the same of a child presenting what they’ve drawn to their parent. 
my parent, whilst trying their best, was not always the most emotionally mature. oftentimes my excitement about my drawing was not shared, but it was rather met with bewilderment: “<em>this</em> is what you’re excited about?”.
looking to validate my emotions, be it confusion, amusement or curiosity about topics, i look to my friends to share the emotion with them.
this makes me so very vulnerable to confidence-crushing judgement, which i confuse for invalidation. its a major source of disagreements in my life.</p><p>does this mean i will never be able to self-validate? does it mean that i always need a friend who is very strong in their opinions and always wants to share theirs with me? 
do i have to depend on others? does this make me incompatible with people who don’t share excitement about the things i’m excited about?
and most importantly: how fucked am i?</p><p>i have had phases in life where i was able to self-validate easier, but with validation so readily available from social media, my self-validation muscle has shriveled up. </p><p>my answer for now is: just writing. hence, i started this blog. its my own thing, my domain and my space for half-done thoughts. </p><p>enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="why-am-i-so-unflexible">why am i so unflexible?</h3>
<p>imagine this situation: 
you’re climbing. you know you can reach the top if you <em>just step up</em> the next boulder. you stretch your foot up, manage to place it half-securely on the boulder, and… you feel that your hips are not strong enough to pull yourself up. you are stuck in a very uncomfortable splits-like pose. </p><p>unflexibility is an automatic mechanism to protect your joints from snapping. 
if the body does not have the strength to support you in a certain pose, it contracts your muscles automatically to preserve your joints.</p><h3 id="well-how-can-i-get-flexible-then">well, how can i get flexible then?</h3>
<p>to get flexible sustainably, you need to build strength at the end of your range of motion. 
in a good strength training, given you utilize the entirety of your ROM, this happens automatically. 
you can also train for specific skills. </p><h3 id="example-pike">example: pike</h3>
<ol>
<li>find your ROM in pike position (hands grabbing calves and hinging at the hip down). you’ll find it when your muscles (here: hamstrings, calves) start to contract.</li>
<li>lean into the concraction: tense the muscles as hard as you can, as far as you can comfortably go, as long as you can, and pull yourself as hard as you can. do 10 reps x 3 sets.</li>
<li>this can be applied to any static stretch. bang those out 2-3 times a week. </li>
<li>???</li>
<li>profit!</li>
</ol>

i do have a computer science bachelors. 
however, i did suffer massively from the paradox of choice.</p><p>this sunday i thought its time for a blog. 
i gave twitter too many of my words already. i twote like ~200.000 posts over a 8-year span. 
and tumblr was too messy for me to blog on (also, i am scared of the community). </p><h3 id="the-process-the-tools">the process, the tools</h3>
<ol>
<li>google “how to microblog”. be overwhelmed. too many words. </li>
<li>type “host own blog” into youtube. hope someone says something along the lines of “github pages”. </li>
<li>watch a video of a guy massively overengineering his notes into a website on github pages (half victory)</li>
<li>find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk8g454nHu0">holy grail video</a> of a guy (after many lectures and hours of programming uni, i understood how a website works?)</li>
<li>download publii</li>
<li>set up pages</li>
<li>set up cloudflare protection for my domain</li>
<li>set up subdomain through CF</li>
<li>… it’s … a blog?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">what i learned</h3>
<p>a website does not need much. it is a domain, a hosting provider and a CMS.
a domain can be free (github pages default or neocities), 
hosting too (see above),
and the CMS can <em>also</em> be free (thanks publii). </p><p>and emotionally? i learned it does not need to be hard. computer scientists tend to flex with the state-of-the-art tools and security features they used to overcomplicate a simple task – i am not those kinds of people, i am initimidated my big words. </p>

<p>“Validating is not fixing, correcting, teaching a lesson, or providing advice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>lately i’ve been thinking about why i don’t create more when i’ve been <em>buzzing</em> with ideas. 
the ideas sound like this in my head: 
    - “this <em>weirdly specific</em> thing i use daily kinda sucks, why don’t i fix it? i shan’t complain if i can’t make it better, no?” 
    - “i just made a connection so outlandish i don’t even really think it’s possible” 
    - “this is morbidly funny, what more is there?”</p><p>when the beehive (my many streams of thought) is angered i usually go on to research everything and anything that remotely connects to this thing. it takes up a lot of my day. 
i tend to research everything i am curious about very deeply, but i don’t tend to write about it. </p><p>to the annoyances of my friend (the one i am emotionally handcuffed to at the time), after hours of research, i run my ideas past them. try to mention them casually, as if i’ve just heard about the thing, trying to gauge if its something to be interested in. </p><p>now here’s the kicker: the idea lives or dies here. if my friend, for any reason, does not respond in a way my trauma-damaged brain has deemed as acceptable, the idea and the hours of research are in vain. 
the moment of getting a response gives me an adrenaline rush and a pang of pain at the same time: my emotional state is the same of a child presenting what they’ve drawn to their parent. 
my parent, whilst trying their best, was not always the most emotionally mature. oftentimes my excitement about my drawing was not shared, but it was rather met with bewilderment: “<em>this</em> is what you’re excited about?”.
looking to validate my emotions, be it confusion, amusement or curiosity about topics, i look to my friends to share the emotion with them.
this makes me so very vulnerable to confidence-crushing judgement, which i confuse for invalidation. its a major source of disagreements in my life.</p><p>does this mean i will never be able to self-validate? does it mean that i always need a friend who is very strong in their opinions and always wants to share theirs with me? 
do i have to depend on others? does this make me incompatible with people who don’t share excitement about the things i’m excited about?
and most importantly: how fucked am i?</p><p>i have had phases in life where i was able to self-validate easier, but with validation so readily available from social media, my self-validation muscle has shriveled up. </p><p>my answer for now is: just writing. hence, i started this blog. its my own thing, my domain and my space for half-done thoughts. </p><p>enjoy!</p>
